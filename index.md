# Professional Self Assessment

  Throughout the journey to recieve a BS in Computer Science, I have learned a lot of skills and in turn have focused on what my path in the field of computer science should be. In this ePortfolio you will see examples of my ability to create and use multiple algorithms and data structures, create software with security measures to protect sensitive data, and build and manipulate databases as well as writing custom SQL queries to show detailed tables from larger datasets. During my time in the CS program I also learned how to work in a team environment by utilizing github to collaborate with classmates on projects, and the basics of working in an agile work environment. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/brownt92/brownt92.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Artifacts

In this ePortfolio there are three artifacts I feel best showcase some of the skills I learned throughout the course of obtaining my Bachelor's degree at SNHU. These artifacts display a solid foundation in database management, use and construction of data sets and algorithms, and software development with a security mindset.

### Authentication System ( Java )

This is an Authentication System written in Java. It asks the user in the command line for a usernasme and password, encrypts the password, then verifies the encrypted string and username are present in a mock database comtaining all employee login information.[Source code here](https://github.com/brownt92/brownt92.github.io/tree/main/AuthenticationSystem)

![Login Attempt Lock](Images/loginattempt.PNG)

The program only allows three failed attempts at login before locking the user out.

![Encryption](Images/passwordencryption.PNG)

Here is a look at the code to encrypt the given password.

### Database Script ( SQL )
This artifact is an SQL script used to simulate a phone companmy database that stores customers info and messages and query and build tables to better visualize the data.
[Source code here](https://github.com/brownt92/brownt92.github.io/tree/main/Database%20Management)

![Create Table Script](Images/createtable.PNG)

Script to create a new table in the company's database.

![Query from multiple tables](Images/querytables.PNG)

Query script to create a new table usinmg values from other tables in the database.

### Data Structures and Algorithms ( C++ )

![Binary Search Tree](Images/searchtree.PNG)
![Vector Sort](Images/vectorsort.PNG)

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brownt92/brownt92.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
